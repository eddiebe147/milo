## Current Stage Details

### Stage 8: Polish & Harden (CURRENT)

**Checkpoint Question:** "What breaks if I do something stupid?"

**Required:**
- [x] Error handling for all async operations with user-friendly messages
- [x] Loading states for all data fetching operations
- [x] Empty states for lists (tasks, goals, activity logs)
- [x] Input validation and sanitization
- [x] Edge case handling (offline, API failures, corrupted data)
- [x] Fix native module issues (active-win graceful fallback)
- [x] UI consistency audit (spacing, colors, typography)

**Completed Polish Work (Dec 28, 2024):**
- **MissionPanel.tsx**: Rewrote with real store integration, loading/error/empty states, priority indicators, active task highlighting
- **StatsPanel.tsx**: Added aggregated loading/error states with retry functionality
- **StateIndicator.tsx**: Connected to real activity store, proper togglePause implementation with loading state
- **QuickCapture.tsx**: Added success/error feedback toasts, loading state on submit
- **ActivityMonitor.ts**: Added graceful fallback for active-win native module failures

## Implementation Phases Completed

### Phase 1: Foundation ✅
- Electron + Vite + React + TypeScript scaffolding
- SQLite database with full schema
- IPC communication layer
- Pip-Boy theme (CRT effects, glow, scanlines)
- Base UI components

### Phase 2: Intelligence ✅
- Claude API integration
- Morning Briefing dialogue system
- Evening Review dialogue system
- Task parsing with AI
- Activity monitoring (state detection)
- State classification (GREEN/AMBER/RED)

### Phase 3: Feedback ✅ (Just Completed)
- Drift detection nudge system
- AI-generated nudge messages
- Stats dashboard with 7-day trend
- Streak tracking with milestones
- Quick capture with AI parsing
- Nudge toast notifications

2. ✅ Morning Briefing (AI-powered daily planning)
3. ✅ Activity Monitoring (GREEN/AMBER/RED state detection)
4. ✅ Drift Detection & Nudges
5. ✅ Evening Review (Reflection + scoring)
6. ✅ S/N Scoring System (0-100 with gamification)
7. ✅ Pip-Boy Desktop UI

### Integrations (P1)
- ⏳ Notion MCP
- ⏳ Apple Calendar MCP
- ⏳ Apple Notes MCP

### NOT in V1.0 (Scope Fence)

## Git Branches

| Branch | Purpose | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `main` | Stable releases | Phase 1-2 work |
| `feature/phase-3-feedback` | Phase 3 implementation | ✅ Ready to merge |

---

## Known Issues

| Issue | Severity | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| `active-win` native binary path | Medium | Activity monitoring fails in dev mode; needs native module rebuild config |

---

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Dec 28, 2024 | Use `active-win` npm package for activity monitoring | Safer than shell-based AppleScript, cross-platform support |
| Dec 28, 2024 | SQLite over cloud DB | Privacy-first, offline capable, simpler architecture |
| Dec 28, 2024 | Electron over Tauri | Better ecosystem, more mature for macOS tray apps |
| Dec 28, 2024 | Zustand over Redux | Simpler API, less boilerplate for this scope |
| Dec 28, 2024 | Exclude ESM packages from externalization | `active-win` and `nanoid` are ESM-only, must be bundled |
